# Tartarus - .NET Software Licensing System

Secure your C# and Visual Basic WinForm applications with ease using Tartarus, the all-in-one solution for software licensing.

This project is outdated. The connection between the MySql.Data constructor and the Server is insecure. 

I gave some sections of code that you could update to a CRUD API, which should secure the application.
